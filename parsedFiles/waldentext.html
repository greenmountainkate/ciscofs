Hanno and the Phoenicians down to our day; in fine,
account of stock to be taken from time to time, to know
how you stand. It is a labor to task the faculties of a
man, — such problems of profit and loss, of interest, of
tare and tret, and gauging of all kinds in it, as demand
    a universal knowledge.</p>
<p>
I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good
place for business, not solely on account of the railroad
and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may not
be good policy to divulge; it is a good port and a good
foundation. No Neva marshes to be filled; though you
must everywhere build on piles of your own driving. It
is said that a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in
the Neva, would sweep St. Petersburg from the face of
    the earth. </p>

As this business was to be entered into without the
usual capital, it may not be easy to conjecture where
those means, that will still be indispensable to every
such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing,
to come at once to the practical part of the question,
perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a
regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by
a true utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that
the object of clothing is, first, to retain the vital heat,
and secondly, in this state of society, to cover nakedness,
and he may judge how much of any necessary or im-
portant work may be accomplished without adding to
his wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a suit but
once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their
majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit
that fits. They are no better than wooden horses to

hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments
become more assimilated to ourselves, receiving the jim-
press of the wearer's character, until we hesitate to lay
them aside without such delay and medical appliauces
and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man
ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch
in his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety,
commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and
unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience.
But even if the rent is not mended, perhaps the worst
vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my
acquaintances by such tests as this, — Who could wear
a patch, or two extra seams only, over the knee ? Most
behave as if they believed that their prospects for life
would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier
for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with
a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a
gentleman's legs, they can be mended; but if a similar
accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there
is no help for it; for he considers, not what is truly
respectable, but what is respected. We know but few
men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scare-
crow in your last shift, you standing shiftless by, who
would not soonest salute the scarecrow ? Passing a
cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat on a
stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only
a little more weather-beaten than when I saw him last.
I have heard of a dog that barked at every stranger who
approached his master's premises with clothes on, but
was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an interesting
question how far men would retain their relative rank

if they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in
such a case, tell surely of any company of civilized men
which belonged to the most respected class? When
Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round the
world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic
Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing
other than a travelling dress, when she went to meet the
authorities, for she "was now in a civilized country,
where . . . people are judged of by their clothes."
Even in our democratic New England towns the acci-'
dental possession of wealth, and its manifestation in
dress and equipage alone, obtain for the possessor al-
most universal respect. But they who yield such respect,
numerous as they are, are so far^fiajhen, and need to
have a missionary sent to them. Beside, clothes intro-
duced sewing, a kind of work which you may call end-
less; a woman's dress, at least, is never done.

A man who has at length found something to do will
not need to get a new suit to do it in; for him the old
will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an indeter-
minate period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than
they have served his valet, — if a hero ever has a valet,
— bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them
do. Only they who go to soirees and legislative halls
must have new coats, coats to change as often as the
man changes in them. But if my jacket and trousers,
my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will
do; will they not ? Who ever saw his old clothes, — his
old coat, actually worn out, resolved into its primitive
elements, so that it was not a deed of charity to bestow
it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed

on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could
do with less ? I say, beware of all enterprises that require
new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If
there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made
to fit ? If you have any enterprise before you, try it in
your old clothes. All men want, not something to da
with, but something to do, or rather something to he.
Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however
ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so
enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like
new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like
keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season,
like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our Uves. The
loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the
snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy
coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes
are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise
we shall be found sailing under false colors, and be in-
evitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well
as that of mankind.

We don garment after garment, as if we grew like
exogenous plants by addition without. Our outside and
often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or
false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be
stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our
thicker garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integ-
ument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber, or true
bark, which cannot be removed without girdling and so
destroying the man. I believe that all races at some
seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is
desirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay
